# Tilt Ball Challange

based on Game template by Stewart Robinson (StewVed) in 2016.

I know there are loads of games like this, but I want to
see how well HTML5 handles a devices hardware.

The Plan:
use the device's gyro stuff to determine pitch and yaw, and use
that data to move a ball.

Next is the hard part; make up lots of mazes and challenges!
